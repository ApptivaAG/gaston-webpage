## Hosts are very happy to have Gaston

The hosts are very happy to have Gaston because it allows them to serve the guests faster. In addition, it is possible to offer ordering only with Gaston for tables that are a little further away, and thus only have to bring the food and drinks to these tables. The staff no longer has to take the order or collect the money.
