In the last quarter we delivered a very big and some smaller improvements for Gaston. Most notable is the ability to make the offer and prices dependent on location and time. Now many scenarios are possible that were previously tedious or not possible at all. Like to adjust the prices for happy hour. Also, certain dishes are cheaper than usual on a special day of the week. In addition, it was previously cumbersome to adjust the offer according to the kitchen opening hours. And it was not possible to offer a different selection for certain tables (e.g. in the garden) or for take away or delivery.

## Dynamic offer selection

With the latest update, the menu card can display a different offer according to the place and time. A classic example are the opening hours of the kitchen. When the kitchen is open, the guests can order everything that the kitchen offers. If the kitchen is closed, these items are not visible and cannot be ordered. With the dynamic offer it is also possible to allow certain articles to only be served in the restaurant but not for take away and delivery.

Since the offer selection can even be customized per table, there are almost no limits to the imagination: Are only drinks available in the garden? Is the food only available in the dining room? Can the fondue only be ordered at the large table? Is a special dish offer only available in autumn? Is the Monday menu only available on Monday? All this can now be elegantly solved with the dynamic offer.

## Dynamic prices

Prices are not the same everywhere and at all times. It is possible that other prices are charged for takeaway or delivery. Also a happy hour is not uncommon, where the prices on certain items are reduced. The guests always see the current price. If the price has changed in the meantime, a price change is indicated at checkout. Accordingly, the guests can then decide whether they still want to order the affected items.

With dynamic prices, many new scenarios are also possible: On Monday, sushi is reduced. On the tennis court, food is slightly more expensive. All drinks cost only half between 16:00 and 18:00.

## Minor improvements

In addition to dynamic offers and pricing, we improved the following:

- Improved and more comprehensive receipt
- Ability to call service staff from the app
- Faster updating of the menu
- Turn order comments on and off

## Outlook

We have some nice features planned for the next few months. For example, payment at the end of the visit is one of the features we are particularly looking forward to. What is planned, you can always see on our [roadmap](https://www.notion.so/gastonsolution/Roadmap-von-Gaston-6644875d1fba4fe58cacfbf15e1ace7e).
